Terraform state file?
=====================
Terraform stores information about infrastructure in a state file. 
This state file keeps track of resources created by configuration 
and maps them to real-world resources.

What is terraform lifecycle?

What is LDAP and how does is work?
==================================
An LDAP server, also called a Directory System Agent (DSA), runs 
on Windows OS and Unix/Linux. It stores usernames, passwords, and 
other core user identities. It uses this data to authenticate users 
when it receives requests or queries and shares the requests with 
other DSAs. Several applications and services can connect to a server 
at once to validate users.

what is Storage Virtualization   and how does it work?
========================================================
In storage virtualization, multiple physical disks are combined into a 
group and from that group of physical disks, virtual storage or logical 
storage blocks are assigned to a server for use. The simplest examples 
of storage virtualization object are LUN's (Logical unit number), 
Logical volume (LV), RAID groups, etc.

What is version control?
==========================
The purpose of version control is to allow software teams track 
changes to the code, while enhancing communication and collaboration 
between team members. Version control facilitates a continuous, simple 
way to develop software.


How to reduce LVM partition size in RHEL and CentOS

Step 2:Start and  force  a filesystem check
Step 3:Resize  your  filesystem before resize your Logical  Volume
Step 4: Reduce  LVM size
Step 5: Re-run resize2fs 

Ansible for deployment 
========================
Ansible is the simplest way to deploy your applications. It gives 
you the power to deploy multi-tier applications reliably and 
consistently, all from one common framework. 
You can configure needed services as well as push application 
artifacts from one common system.
